Not only that, but we\nhave a range of competing implementations that offer different privacy\ntradeoffs! Supergeil!\nFor some reason, the same effort has not piled into securing\nfiles. While we have age gradually\ndisplacing GPG for messaging (see a pattern?), the vast majority of\nfile security and backup softwares are rooted in the 90s.\nIn the rest of the article I'm going to rant a bit before I arrive at\nmy solution. Jump ahead if you're in a\nrush.\nUsable security (or lack thereof)\nOn the one hand, we have robust tools that have been tested and vetted\nthrough exposure to time, which is great! Many eyeballs make every\nusability hell shallow (or something like that).\nOn the other hand, this feels backwards: people are getting top notch\nuser interfaces from Silicon Valley startups and gigacorps, while they\nhave to navigate archaic and arcane configurations to secure their\nacademic research with VeraCrypt.\nHow should anyone know whether TwoFish is a reasonable choice of\nencryption, or they need to mix it with\nTurboFish-GUI-SIV mode using Visual\nBasic to make this\nsecure for their needs?\nProprietary software for file storage is cute, but mostly built for\nthe enterprise market. And let's not delude ourselves about the\nquality of this stuff, these products are typically optimized for\nrevenue over security.\n\"Can I still access my data trivially in 10 years time?\" is a\nquestion I've heard multiple times during my research. Some people\nI've spoken to specifically avoid proprietary tools because their\nlongevity is questionable.\nIt seems that currently we can't have it both ways: it's either\nsecure, or usable. \nAnd then: portability.\nMany of open source backup software are written in Python. Performance\nhit the bottle's neck quickly and the fix was to add some C. And maybe\ndo some exec() calls to a few ready-made software that's going to\ncut down on code size. Now you need a few different package managers\nto handle the complexity.\nAll of this stuff is unapologetically designed for Linux, with a\ntypical Linux user in mind from the 2000s when we were all compiling\nGentoo from stage1 to achieve best in class desktop performance (we\nnever did).\nRecently, I had to spend a week away from my regular desktop, with a\nLinux laptop. \"I have backups!\", or so I thought. Until I realised\nit's going to take a non-trivial amount of time to recover those from\nencrypted TimeMachine archives. It slowly sank in that my flawless\nstrategy is utterly useless if I change one variable: the part of the\ncomputing stack that runs a browser and an Emacs, the operating\nsystem.\nTry using any Python open source stuff on Windows, and you'll feel the\npain. WSL2 is cheating, that's a Linux\nsystem!\nAnd then: performance.\nNeedless to say, when any system depends on layers and layers of code\nand third party tools, it becomes a lot harder to tame\nperformance. But things get even worse when you consider networks.\nIn the past I've made the mistake of blindly shoveling data into a\ncloud backup provider with an open source client. I've even tested my\nbackups! It was great. An endless pit of data on the cheap.\nThat is, until I had to do a full system restore. Downloading and\nunpacking about 1TB took 3 or 4 days on a fast European Internet\nconnection. That's when I realised that while I had lots of\nbandwidth, the latency to access chunks of my data were\nhorrifically slow. Welp.\nSo how do we fix file storage?\nIn the last year of the Before Times, I wrote a prototype of\nZerostash in Rust, with\na few design goals in mind:\n\nMake it easy to re-implement in arbitrary languages\nAllow for a large number of use cases without hellish configuration\nMake it secure by default\nMake it fast\n\nThe truth is, the original scheme sucked. Not because I messed up the\ngoals, thankfully. It was an overly complex design that ultimately\nscaled badly. Many features were impossible to implement. It was\nreally, very fast, though.\nSo about a year ago I resigned at my dayjob, and decided spend my\nfunemployed year learning how to enjoy writing software again by\nmaking Zerostash not suck.\nAnd here we are. Zerostash is now a fully usable, multiplatform,\nincremental, deduplicated backup tool that doesn't suck (so much).\nThe CLI is modelled vaguely after Git commands, since it works pretty\nsimilarly to Git internally. You get to commit, checkout, ls, and\nlog your archives. \nWhere does a newborn go from here?\nOne of the aspects of\nZerostash and the\nunderlying Infinitree\nlibrary that I like the most is that the design allows building a\nbunch of different user experiences around one secure core.\n\nIntegrate it silently into a GUI thingy? Sure.\nFile systems through FUSE? Why not.\nSync &amp; restore your workspace anywhere at high speeds? Please do.\nEncrypted Git? Yes please.\nTransparently encrypt all your customer data in Amazon S3? Hell yeah.\nStore your microservice application state in the cloud before reload?\nOf course.\nBuild a replicated, encrypted database to replace your SQL logic\nwith native Rust iterators? Ehm, maybe...\n\nIn the coming weeks, I will go through some design decisions and\nsolutions that went into Infinitree and Zerostash so they scale up and\ndown.\nThere are also a bunch of mundane things to implement, like garbage\ncollection, or integrating streams into the CLI to allow ZFS piping\nsnapshots into Zerostash.\nFuck around and find out\nGoing forward, I would love to continue working on Zerostash and the\nsurrounding Rust ecosystem in a focused way, and I am looking for\npeople who would support this journey!\nIf you or your organization is in need of improving your data\nmanagement story, why not hire me?\nSend me an email at p at symmetree.dev!\n","id":"https://symmetree.dev/blog/01-serious-backups/","title":"Time to take a hard look at securing files"},"https://symmetree.dev/blog/02-anatomy-of-encrypted-storage/":{"body":"If you have tuned into our pilot episode,\nyou should have gotten a glimpse of the issues I see in the current\nlandscape of secure archiving tools, and what a new tool should\ndo. I, however, never elaborated on how that would happen. \nThe last release of\nZerostash\nnow supports local caching of archives, S3 remotes, and natively using\nmacOS Keychain and keyfiles to store credentials. This provides great\napropo for me to elaborate on what makes this possible.\nThis is a long read, so buckle up, get a beverage, and put on your\nmonocle.\nWhere We're Going\nFor those of you who have missed our previous programming (the British\nprogramming, where they talk about the telly), Zerostash is solving\nthe following technical problems:\n\nStore large amounts of files securely in random access archives.\nDo not leak metadata like archive or file size.\nDo not require extra server software apart from file storage.\nThe archives should be cheap to replicate, synchronize.\nStore only incremental changes.\nStay as fast as possible for most use cases.\n\nOk, this (sorta) makes sense, but \"most use cases\" definitely sounds\nlike a thing to noodle on a bit more.\nMost Use Cases\nCovering or even identifying every use case is hard, because everybody\nwants to do backups differently.\nSome people will want to create a snapshot of their current work\nenvironment, and occasionally send that off to their local or cloud\nstorage. Some will use hard drives and put them in a safe. Some will\nuse a combination of both. Some are afraid of Mossad, others are\nafraid of Not\nMossad.\n\n\nIn addition, people are not only doing backups. Activists,\njournalists, and researchers will want to preserve or, occasionally,\nshare stashes of documents with others securely without using\nexcessive bandwidth.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add extra complexity, all platforms now ship their own cloud\nstorage solutions built-in and ready to go. The common thing among\nthem is that neither of these services actually hide the data from the\nstorage provider. Yet, UX integration expectations from users are\nhigh, the lines between local and remote are intentionally blurred by\noperating system vendors.\nIt would be great if we could engineer a solution that does it all.\nPhysical Layout\nWhat we should be aiming for then, seems like a sort of overlay file\nsystem that's versatile enough to be used across all operating\nsystems, and as a core for different applications.\nTo circumvent the latency implications of dealing with a lot of files,\nstemming mostly from syscall overhead and round trip times in a\nnetworked environment, we're going to need some packing.\nZerostash packs ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypted chunks of data in 4MiB\nobjects. These chunks use convergent encryption, which means the same\ncleartext will encrypt to the same cyphertext within the same\nstash. Chunks can be part of a file, or some serialized data structure\nthat helps us index all the content in the stash. But let's not jump\nahead.\n\nWhy 4MiB? It's fast enough to transfer on most internet connections,\nafter all many\nwebsites\nare larger than\nthat.\nAdditionally, most modern SSDs will use a block size of a few\nmegabytes, which means\nhanding round sized write() calls to the controller (through the\nfilesystem) will theoretically give us aligned access and better\nperformance.\nIf there isn't 4MiB worth of chunks in an object, Zerostash will fill\nthe unused segments with random, creating purple 4MiB blobs that look\nindistinguishable from /dev/urandom output.\n; ent ~/Code/repo/1deb3559bd4d50571348fcae36c4f48cb4aad9e7a834e6449a7daced258ffa59\nEntropy = 7.999959 bits per byte.\n\nOptimum compression would reduce the size\nof this 4194304 byte file by 0 percent.\n\nChi square distribution for 4194304 samples is 237.60, and randomly\nwould exceed this value 77.61 percent of the times.\n\nArithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4687 (127.5 = random).\nMonte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141657964 (error 0.00 percent).\nSerial correlation coefficient is 0.000192 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).\n\nYes, my prompt starts with ;.\nObjects also have an ID, so we know how to call them. This ID serves\nno real purpose, in the sense that it doesn't validate the integrity\nof the object. It is just more random-looking bytes.\nThe ID needs to be some random value, because we want to be able to\nrewrite some of the objects without changing their ID. Why would we\ndo that? Because specialized servers belong in Michelin-star\nrestaurants.\nThis object size and naming convention helps us synchronize partial\nupdates to the archive, regardless of the underlying file system,\nsyncing mechanism, or storage backend, while maintaining a relatively\ndecent throughput/latency tradeoff.\nDetecting changes to an object is as simple as looking at the\nmodification time. Extra objects can be added or removed based on\ncomparison of file listings.\nSimple enough? Sure, let's see how to fill all this random with useful\nstuff.\nBootstrapping to Infinity\nAt the core of Zerostash is a library called\nInfinitree to\nhandle... infinite trees.\nIn fact, Infinitree handles all the storage-y stuff described above,\nand allows Zerostash to use a high-level API for its model like this:\ntype ChunkIndex = fields::VersionedMap&lt;Digest, ChunkPointer&gt;;\ntype FileIndex = fields::VersionedMap&lt;String, Entry&gt;;\n\n#[derive(Clone, Default, Index)]\npub struct Files {\n    pub chunks: ChunkIndex,\n    pub files: FileIndex,\n}\n\nSo how, exactly, do we reach ChunkIndex and FileIndex from our\nencrypted chunks sitting in randomly named objects?\nWell, remember when I said random IDs serve no purpose? I lied. They\nactually serve the purpose of hiding the root of the tree itself.\nThis is what happens when we open a tree:\n\nThe name of the root object is derived from the user password, along\nwith the encryption keys. Specifically, the output of an Argon2 KDF is\nused to derive Blake3\nsubkeys\nfor various purposes.\nThe root object also has a special twist: it has a 512 byte header.\nIn Infinitree 0.8, the header is a simple ChunkPointer that looks like this:\npub(crate) struct RawChunkPointer {\n    pub offs: u32,\n    pub size: u32,\n    pub file: ObjectId,\n    pub hash: Digest,\n    pub tag: Tag,\n}\n\nThis root chunk pointer is contains all the information required for\nus to get to the next chunk, which contains a list of chunk pointers\nwe call a Stream:\npub struct Stream(Vec&lt;ChunkPointer&gt;);\n\nReading through the chunks in the Stream will allow us to decrypt\nthe transaction list, which in turn allows us to select a version to\nrestore into memory, through, you guessed it, more Streams and\nChunkPointers. In the code example above, the VersionedMaps are\nresponsible for dumping and restoring their state from Streams.\nThe transaction list looks like this:\npub(crate) type Field = String;\npub(crate) type TransactionPointer = (CommitId, Field, Stream);\n\n/// A list of transactions, represented in order, for versions and fields\npub(crate) type TransactionList = Vec&lt;TransactionPointer&gt;;\n\nGoing through the transactions belonging to a particular Field and\nCommitId, we can deserialize the contents of our ChunkIndex and\nFileIndex data structures mentioned above.\n\nWe can roll the transaction list up from the CommitId which we want\nto restore all the way to the root, and filter the fields we're\ninterested in.\nFor instance, there's no point restoring the full ChunkIndex if\nwe're only looking to run 0s checkout on some files, since that\nfield is never used. We do need it, however, when we want to stash\nmore stuff in the stash with 0s commit.\nAs you can see above, all ChunkPointers include a Tag, which is\nessentially the MAC of the cyphertext as generated by the\nChaCha20-Poly1305 cypher.\nThe CommitId is then generated by taking Blake3 hash of all the\nChunkPointers that are included in all transactions that make up a\ncommit, as well as some additional metadata, such as the previous\ncommit's id, ensuring that all contents of the index are sealed. This\nis very similar to how Git handles commit hashes.\nThe transaction list is rewritten in its entirety on every commit to\nsave space on the storage. However, saving a new commit will always\ncreate at least one new 4MiB object.\nA minimum size for commits somewhat limits the utility of Zerostash\nfor large numbers of small changes, but theoretically there's\nnothing stopping the implementation to track and re-use objects based\non utilization, or, how much useless random we put at the\nend. Tracking where each object ends, then syncing and re-syncing them\nwill increase caching complexity, but potentially improves privacy by\ncreating less deterministic access patterns.\nCaching\nSince the files that make up the stash mostly don't change, we can\ncache them quite efficiently.\nBetter still, Zerostash always bypasses the cache to read the root\nobject when opening a stash. If the remote version changed, all the\nChunkPointers in it must have changed, too, invalidating parts of\nthe local cache.\nWarming up the cache can happen by simply re-syncing the objects\nreferenced in the transaction list's Stream descriptor based on\ntheir ETag, modification timestamp, or even hash if our tools support\nit.\nCurrently Zerostash can maintain a least-recently-used cache of\nobjects, and will evict objects to keep a fix size. However, the index\nis always kept warm in the cache, so your local cache doubles up as a\nfully functioning local repository you can write to or query.\nThis also means that only a reasonably small portion of the stash\nneeds to be available to add more data into it: the index. The index\nis typically less than 0.5% of the size of all data stored in the\nstash, which means using a storage backend like Amazon Glacier is just\na matter of some medium-complexity code and a few tough decisions.\nUnfinished Business\nThe simple setup is, well, simple, but not without shortcomings. For\none, changing the master password is not straightforward. It was also\nhighlighted to me that this design is potentially susceptible to\npartitioning oracle attacks,\nalthough the risk should be limited.\nThe base object system, with a few extensions, should be able to\nunderpin all sorts of user experiences. In my (admittedly not very\nscientific) experiments on an M1 Macbook Air, Zerostash can achieve\n500-1200MiB/s when archiving, and around 6-800MiB/s when unarchiving,\ndepending on the input.\nOptimizations, features, and a more rounded user experience can be\ndeveloped around the core that exists, and my little list of things\nthat would be cool to do just keeps getting longer.\nDirty Business\nIf you've enjoyed our journey today, you may consider subscribing to\nthe RSS feed or tuning in to my idle thoughts at the\nvillage square.\nGoing forward, I would love to continue working on Zerostash and the\nsurrounding Rust ecosystem in a focused way, and I am looking for\npeople who want to support this journey!\nIf you or your organization is in need of improving your data\nmanagement story, why not hire me?\nSend me an email at p at symmetree.dev!\n","id":"https://symmetree.dev/blog/02-anatomy-of-encrypted-storage/","title":"Stash, Cache, and Keys: Anatomy of Encrypted Storage"},"https://symmetree.dev/blog/03-hardware-and-asymmetry-05/":{"body":"0.5 is a huge milestone for Zerostash, paving the way for some long-term plans, including truly write-only backups. With 0.5, we're half-way there to truly ransomware-resistant backups. In this process, Zerostash 0.5 will also transparently upgrade your existing archives to a more robust encryption scheme that mitigates nonce-reuse and potential partitioning oracle attacks.\nWrite-only archives\nWith Zerostash 0.5 you can create a write-only archive on an ordinary storage. While this mode is not useful against an attacker destroying your backups, it will help you make sure they can't read the archive contents without the correct keys. Note that the index is still accessible using your symmetric password, so they'll see all the file names, but not the contents.\nThis is how you do back up your entire /:\n0s keys gen /path/to/stash split_key --user server_backup@symmetree.dev \\\n                                     --read-keyfile ~/read_key.toml \\\n                                     --write-keyfile ~/write_key.toml\n0s commit --keyfile ~/write.key.toml /path/to/stash /\n\nHardware-based encryption with Yubikeys\nRoad warriors will appreciate that there's now a way to give a bit more of a personal touch to their backups. A Yubikey configured to perform Challenge-Response HMAC-SHA1 operations can require a touch to decrypt then re-seal the archive. Using challenge-response mode also allows you to easily create a backup Yubikey.\nNote, that if you decide that touch is what you want, you will need to pay attention to when 0s finishes crunching your data, and seals the stash. To set up the Yubikey, consult the amazing documentation by Strongbox. If you just wanted to create an archive of your user directory on an external disk, this is how you do it:\n0s commit --yubikey /mnt/path/to/stash /home/user\n\nDepending on your preferences, you may want to create a keyfile:\n0s keys gen /mnt/path/to/stash yubikey slot2 hmac1 --user road_warrior@symmetree.dev --keyfile home_backup.toml \n\nHardware security with macOS Keychain\nmacOS users will appreciate that they can configure Keychain to store their passwords. On modern mac laptops, this means your Zerostash credentials are protected by the Secure Enclave. You can use this feature in conjunction with your Yubikey or split_key keys, too. If you're adventurous, synchronizing your Keychain with your iCloud account will enable access to your stashes on other fruity devices.\nTo generate a keyfile with Yubikey that picks your password from Keychain:\n0s keys gen /mnt/path/to/stash yubikey --keychain --keyfile home_backup.toml\n\nTo simply run a backup and save the password to Keychain:\n0s keys commit --keychain --user home_backup@symmetree.dev /mnt/path/to/stash /home/user\n\nChanging password\nUp until now, there was now way to change the password of a stash once you create it.

In other words, a cryptographic primitive must\nprovide interfaces that cannot be used in a way that results in a\ncompromise of core security assurances.\nThere is a very good reason people in crypto worlds, both as in\n-graphy and -currency, are enthusiastic about Rust: the type system is\nrich enough that we can make invalid states inexpressible in the code.\nThis property allows a large number of assumptions to be validated at\ncompile time, therefore making our runtime reasoning about the states\nin which the program can be much simpler.\nThis kind of well-defined world gets much more complex to control once\nwe try to expose the associated functionality on a CLI. In this fairly\nlong ride, I'll do a quick introduction of how it's done in one of the\ncore Rust cryptographic libraries that also underpins\nrustls, then dive into some\nZerostash internals\nthat drove the new command line\noptions in 0.5.\nCommunicating intent in Ring\nTake, a real life example from\ninfinitree of using\nring, a Rust wrapper around\nGoogle's BoringSSL.\nuse ring::aead;\n\nlet key =\n        aead::UnboundKey::new(&amp;aead::CHACHA20_POLY1305, key.expose_secret()).expect(\"bad key\");\n\nlet aead = aead::LessSafeKey::new(key);\n\nlet nonce = {\n    let mut buf = Nonce::default();\n    buf.copy_from_slice(&amp;sealed[HEADER_CYPHERTEXT..]);\n    aead::Nonce::assume_unique_for_key(buf)\n};\n\nlet decrypted = aead\n    .open_in_place(nonce, aead::Aad::empty(), &amp;mut buf[..HEADER_CYPHERTEXT])\n    .map_err(CryptoError::from)?;\n\nThere are a few things going on here, so let's go through what\nhappens, piece by piece, with an attention to how the API helps\nunderstanding implementation.\naead::UnboundKey::new(&amp;aead::CHACHA20_POLY1305, key.expose_secret()).expect(\"bad key\");\n\nFirst off,\nUnboundKey,\naccording to the docs, is a \"An AEAD key without a designated role or\nnonce sequence.\". The new() constructor, as we're used to in Rust,\nwill create us a key that is not bound to any nonce sequence. We\ncan't, therefore accidentally use the wrong kind of key in an\nunexpected place. It's a different type.\naead::LessSafeKey::new(key)\n\nLessSafeKey? Huh? Less safe than what? Let's see what the\nfox docs say:\n\nImmutable keys for use in situations where OpeningKey/SealingKey\nand NonceSequence cannot reasonably be used.\nPrefer to use OpeningKey/SealingKey and NonceSequence when\npractical.\n\nAh, that makes sense! There are better ways of using the API, but they\nare not always practical, so there's a less safe version that can be\nused more freely!\naead::Nonce::assume_unique_for_key(buf)\n\nThe constructor's name itself is highlighting to the API user that the\nn-once\nvalue must be unique. It's an important implementation\ndetail, an externality that cannot be sufficiently safeguarded against\nby the type system. Even if the open_in_place function consumes\nnonce, there's no way for the type system to ensure it's globally\nunique for every use of the key in the universe.\naead.open_in_place(nonce, aead::Aad::empty(), &amp;mut buf[..HEADER_CYPHERTEXT])\n\nAnd finally, a single glance at open_in_place will tell us\neverything about the data and parameters of the actual decryption\noperation.\nControlling the API complexity\nAn API that programmers use requires very different UX considerations\nfrom a tool on the command line. However, users of both will want most\nof the same assurances.\nWhile the underlying misuse-resistant API means it is easy to create\nan opinionated system that does The Right Thing one way, introducing a\nchoice into this user experience is riddled with traps.\nBefore infinitree 0.9, there was no way to change the encryption\nkeys of a tree after creating it. This was a direct result of mostly\nprofiler-driven development, and I kind of left it there to fix it\nlater. Everything worked, and it was oh so simple!\nFor\nreasons,\nchanging keys requires some assumptions. Establishing the API that now\nprovides the right amount of flexibility, static type checking, and\nease of use, required a few iterations.\nThis is how one changes the password in infinitree 0.9, ignoring all\nthe uses:\n\nlet key = ChangeHeaderKey::swap_on_seal(\n    UsernamePassword::with_credentials(\"username\".to_string(),\n                                       \"old_password\".to_string()).unwrap(),\n    UsernamePassword::with_credentials(\"username\".to_string(),\n                                       \"new_password\".to_string()).unwrap(),\n);\n\nlet mut tree = Infinitree::&lt;VersionedMap&lt;String, String&gt;&gt;::open(\n    Directory::new(\"/storage\").unwrap(),\n    key\n).unwrap();\n\ntree.reseal();\n\nLooks simple enough. It might be surprising at first that\nthere's a special ChangeHeaderKey type instead of just swap_key\nfor the tree instance.\nThis is because under the hood, I wanted to ensure that all\nexpressible key transitions are safe, and this is statically ensured\nby the type system.\nFor what you see, you see, is a lie.\npub type UsernamePassword = KeyingScheme&lt;Argon2UserPass, Symmetric&gt;;\n\nInternally, the UsernamePassword encryption scheme is a combination\nof an encrypted header format, and symmetric AEAD cypher. Changing the\nheader format should be possible. Changing the internal symmetric keys\nmakes all data inaccessible.\nChangeHeaderKey uses generics enforce the rules.\npub struct ChangeHeaderKey&lt;H, N, I&gt; {\n    opener: Arc&lt;H&gt;,\n    sealer: Arc&lt;N&gt;,\n    convergence: I,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;H, N, I&gt; ChangeHeaderKey&lt;H, N, I&gt; {\n    pub fn swap_on_seal(original: KeyingScheme&lt;H, I&gt;, new: KeyingScheme&lt;N, I&gt;) -&gt; Self {\n        Self {\n            opener: original.header,\n            sealer: new.header,\n            convergence: original.convergence,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo far, this has scaled well enough for the current encryption schemes\nin infinitree, and, since I am not planning on many new features\nhere, it will probably stick around for some time.\nWiring up the command line with clap\nFirst of all, if you've made it this far, congratulations. You deserve\na break.\nAll this nonsense in infinitree is there to make\nZerostash\nsupport some fancy modes of storage, that we need to expose on the\nCLI.\nClap's declarative mode is amazing. Zerostash supports mostly the same\nstuff in the TOML-based configuration language and the command line.\nCompare and contrast.\n[stash.s3.key]\nsource = \"plaintext\"\nuser = \"backup@road-warrior\"\npassword = \"a very secure password\"\n\n[stash.s3.backend]\ntype = \"s3\"\nbucket = \"laptop-backup\"\nregion = { name = \"us-east-1\" }\nkeys = [\"access_key\", \"secret_key\"]\n\n0s commit --user backup@road-warrior s3://access_key:secret_key@us-east-1#/bucket/path /\n\nOk, you can't specify the password on the command line, but apart from\nthat, it's pretty much the same.\nThe trick is that both of the above examples are translated into a\nsymbolic representation of the configuration of a stash.\n#[derive(Default, Clone, Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]\npub struct Stash {\n    pub key: Key,\n    pub backend: Backend,\n    pub alias: String,\n}\n\nAnd, it's symbolic all the way down, including the Key and Backend enums. To create a Stash instance, we're either directly deserializing it from TOML, or we leverage the clap arguments we can include anywhere that will generate a Stash instance for us.\n#[derive(clap::Args, Clone, Debug)]\n#[clap(group(\n            ArgGroup::new(\"key\")\n                .args(&amp;[\"keyfile\", \"keystring\", \"yubikey\"]),\n        ))]\npub struct StashArgs {\n    pub stash: String,\n    #[clap(flatten)]\n    pub symmetric_key: SymmetricKey,\n    #[clap(short, long, value_name = \"PATH\")]\n    pub keyfile: Option&lt;PathBuf&gt;,\n    #[clap(short = 'K', value_name = \"TOML\", long)]\n    pub keystring: Option&lt;String&gt;,\n    #[clap(short, long)]\n    pub yubikey: bool,\n}\n\n\nAll of this will help Zerostash figure out which keys to use, and how\nto turn your command line into a symbolic Stash. All this stays\nsymbolic until Zerostash opens the Stash when everything is\nevaluated and turned into infinitree types, and Zerostash can start\nusing the Infinitree database instance.\nTo change the key of a stash, we need to define the change subcommand:\n#[derive(Command, Debug)]\npub struct Change {\n    #[clap(flatten)]\n    from: StashArgs,\n    #[clap(subcommand)]\n    cmd: ChangeCmd,\n}\n\nThrough a bunch of new clap::Args annotations and getting gradually\nmore specific in how and why we want to change things, we get lost in\nthe details, such as ChangeCmd.\nOne big down side of the declarative clap code, is that for complex\ninterfaces, you'll have a type for everything. And in case you want\nto re-use a subcommand slightly differently, you'll need to break\nout different uses in different places to different structs.\nI'm not saying this is pretty. This gets tedious, and you have to be\npatient.\nBut to cut to the chase, eventually, we want to run the\ncode. Once we distill the command line options to usable\nKey instances, eventually we need to go through the variants of the\nKey enum to map everything into specific types. There's a helper\ntrait that allows the different supported keying schemes to turn into\na specific infinitree::Key instance.\npub trait KeyToSource {\n    type Target;\n    fn to_keysource(self, _stash_name: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self::Target&gt;;\n}\n\nAnd then we end up executing the symbolic Key configuration to\ncreate a ChangeHeaderKey instance, and elide the type. There are a\nfew helper macros to help reduce noise, which is considerable, but in\nthe end, it seems to be necessary to create a huge match block that\nmaps out the valid transitions.\nmacro_rules! change_key {\n    ($stash:ident, $old:expr, $new:expr) =&gt; {\n        Arc::new(infinitree::crypto::ChangeHeaderKey::swap_on_seal(\n            $old.to_keysource($stash)?,\n            $new.to_keysource($stash)?,\n        ))\n    };\n}\n\nimpl KeyToSource for Key {\n    type Target = infinitree::Key;\n\n    fn to_keysource(self, stash: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;infinitree::Key&gt; {\n        Ok(match self {\n\t\t    ...\n\n            Self::ChangeTo { old, new } =&gt; match (*old, *new) {\n                (Key::Interactive, Key::Interactive) =&gt; {\n                    change_key!(stash, old!(), new!())\n                }\n                (Key::Interactive, Key::Userpass(new)) =&gt; change_key!(stash, old!(), new),\n\t\t\t\t\n                ...\n                Map out all valid transitions...\n                ...\n\n                _ =&gt; bail!(\"Old and new keys are incompatible!\"),\n            },\n        })\n    }\n}\n\nThis infinitree::Key instance can then be used to open and reseal a stash:\nlet mut stash = stash_cfg.try_open(Some(key)).expect(\"Stash cannot be opened\");\nif stash.reseal().is_err() {\n    fatal_error(\"Failed to change key\");\n}\n\nAnd the password has been changed!\nConclusion\nThanks for sticking around for this long. My key takeaway is that\nRust helps enormously to control the complexity that arises when we\nmove from the string-heavy CLI interface to a strict API boundary.\nNone of it is magic, though, and there is a considerable amount of\nwork involved in mapping out a large suite of CLI functions,\nconsidering all the externalities a CLI program has to consider, even\nif it all condenses down to a fairly narrow API surface that in turn\nhides the inner complexities of key management.\nAlthough clap's declarative style helps a lot keeping all the functionality\nexplicit, there is a considerable amount of type noise by making\nall uses of the similar but not quite the same configurations mapped\ninto something specific.\nThe robustness of building around the explicit types might be worth\nit, as most of the connections are explicitly checked, and chaining\nthe flow and dependencies is easy to track for the different functions\nexposed by the CLI.\nHappy hacking!\n","id":"https://symmetree.dev/blog/04-api-to-cli/","title":"Carrying API guarantees to the command line with Clap"}},"docInfo":{"https://symmetree.dev/":{"body":162,"title":3},"https://symmetree.dev/blog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://symmetree.dev/blog/01-serious-backups/":{"body":574,"title":6},"https://symmetree.dev/blog/02-anatomy-of-encrypted-storage/":{"body":1016,"title":6},"https://symmetree.dev/blog/03-hardware-and-asymmetry-05/":{"body":310,"title":6},"https://symmetree.dev/blog/04-api-to-cli/":{"body":988,"title":6}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
